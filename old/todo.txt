* Add the following Resources:
  * ResourceCache
  * ResourceRedis
  * ResourceMemcached
  * ResourceOauth2
  * ResourceLogin ? dunno hw this fits with Oauth2 yet
* make Context part of Session
* think a better way to handle Pagination -- possibly through a Session interface?
* deprecate Ider -- it should always be a Record, even if some of the fields are nil. There is no good reason for distinction
* Attempt to deprecate the Nature/Denature process -- not sure how to do this one, but it would simplify a lot
